# bikesharing

## Overview:
  The purpose to analyse Citi bike data to get an idea of how successful can a bike sharing business be if someone start in an other city.
## Results:
By looking at the data and the story visualization of City bike service in New York it seems like it's quite popular in the city and specifically in Manhatten which is always full of tourists and a highly populated area.
  when we look at the chart showing the peak hours in August it is quite obvious that it is highly in demand in business hours specially 8 in the mornings and 5 in      evenings of weekdays. 
  starting and ending locations are mostly in Manhatten.
  There are way more subscribers than customers and the gander pie chart shows that its highly popular in men compair to women.
   By knowing the fact that this analysis applies specifically to New York City and Des Moines must be quite different!
