  starting and ending locations are mostly in Manhatten.
  There are way more subscribers than customers and the gander pie chart shows that its highly popular in men compair to women.

   Darker is more used and needs service accordingly.

   consider the analysis by knowing the fact that this analysis applies specifically to New York City and Des Moines must be quite different!


## Summary:
bike sharing business is quite famous in populated and rush areas of New York.
it has more demand in office hours of weekdays.

it is most reqired in highly populated areas.
Suggestion:
For future anlysis it would be great if we compair the bike utalization with population of the city and the gender breakdown of populaton.

By providing the data of Des Moines including
city population
most populated areas of the city
Gender breakdown of the city will make the analysis more effective.
