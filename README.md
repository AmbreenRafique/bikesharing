# BIKESHARING

## Overview:
  The purpose of this exercise is to analyse Citi bike data to get an idea of how successful a bike sharing business can be if someone starts it in another city.
## Results:
By reviewing the data and the story visualization of City bike service in New York it seems like it's quite popular in the city and specifically in Manhattan which is always full of tourists and is a highly populated area. Here is the link of story visualization of New Yorkâ€™s City bike data.

- When we observe the chart showing the peak hours in August it is quite obvious that the service is in high demand during business hours especially on weekdays between 8 in the morning to 5 in the evening. 
- Starting and End locations are mostly in Manhattan.
- There are way more subscribers than customers and the gender pie chart shows that it is highly popular in men compared to women.
- Bike service and maintenance is another big thing to keep in mind when we consider this business to start. The following  visuals show the utilization and repair of      the bikes according to the data of New York City bike service.

   Dark areas are high use areas and need service accordingly.

   Consider this analysis by acknowledging the fact that the analysis applies specifically to New York City and dynamics of Des Moines may be quite different!


## Summary:
- Bike sharing business is quite famous in populated and rush areas of New York.
- It has more demand in office hours of weekdays.
- It is more popular in men compared to women.
- It is mostly utilized in highly populated areas.

Suggestions:
- For future anlysis it would be great if we compare the bike utilization with population of the city and the gender breakdown of the populaton.

- By providing the relevant data of Des Moines including:
  - City population
  - Most populated areas of the city
  - Gender breakdown of the city will make the analysis more effective.
